/**
 * The properties Vector uses, e.g. a HIVE Map, or even a "JSON-String to carry some Metadata with it".
 * 
 * A different wrapper can handle triples, which are stored in an RDF store to describe the "data lineage graph".
 * 
 * In opposite to the DOAD file (description of a data set) which is a macroscopic 
 * description of the whole data set, this DOAR (decsription of a record) element is the microscopic description 
 * of its elements.
 * 
 * Example: We have measured time series data, like wind speed in several locations.
 * 
 * the measured data is the a key value pair: (k,v) = (time,speed) 
 * the units of measurement is already part of the metadata: [s since t0, km/h]  
 * but in order to define relations between measurements, more data is required.
 * 
 * Implicit information allows to calculate the average value or ordering in time.
 * 
 * But the measurement does not contain location data, nor the device identifier or
 * even device parameters, which might be required to validate the obtained values.
 * 
 * Therefore we use DOAD and DOAR elements, which are compliments to existing.
 *  
 *    DOAD            DOAR           DOAP             PMML
 *    
 *    Description     Description    Description      Predictive Model Markup Language 
 *    of a dataset    of a record    of a project
 * 
 * DOAP and PMML are well known for many years and adopted in many groups. Both are highly correlated
 * hot IT projects worked during the last years. More and more tools have been developed since
 * the Internet allows agile and flexible development processes. The Linux operating system, the 
 * whole Eclipse platform and now the Hadoop ecosystem show in three stages how highly complex systems
 * can emerge from simple tools - this structure formation process requires more than just developers
 * which contribute source code and documentation. Nobody can read all produced texts. Automatic consistency
 * like the dependency checks and type matching analysis which are done during an automatic build cycle are 
 * essential incredients herefore. 
 * 
 * A DOAP file is the description of a project and contains relevant information
 * which allow users to identify if a software project fits or not quickly. The use programming language, supported
 * operation systems, the scope and even the address of the list of known bugs are included. A scan of this this 
 * information, manually or even via tools speeds up the communication process and lowers the barriers for
 * large scale colaboration. 
 * 
 * The results of data analysis procedures are either data tables or charts. In many cases it is not
 * sufficient just to show a plot. The relation between variables is described by a formula which contains
 * a high or low number less constants, derived from the data set. Such models can than be reused. To share
 * such information the PMML was developed since 1997. The contributors have formed the data mining group 
 * DMG (http://www.dmg.org/). Especially theresults of data analysis procedures like classifiers or decision trees
 * are in the focus or the PMML, but not the data set for itselfe.
 * 
 * One has to track the location of all measurement devices and their configuration parameters together with the data set 
 * to achieve traceability. The emerging semantic web offers a technique called RDF graphs, to connect pieces of
 * information with each other. The "Internet of things" already uses this approach. All static metadata about a device 
 * can be stored in database which offers its content using a triple store, which supports so called SPARQL queries. 
 * This allows to point to this details via one single URI. All status information are stored in this system and can be
 * requested via a SPARGL query, starting with the URI of one device. What does this mean for our data set?
 * Not the full set of metadata is required in each data set, one URI us all what is needed a connecting link 
 * to the metadata layer.
 * 
 * Such explicit metadata should not be used very often during data processing. To find out, what the brand and type of
 * a measurement device was it is good to use the external layer, but for correlation analysis such explicit metadata
 * objects have to be aggregated and included into the data set. E.g. the list of geographical locations of all 
 * weather from which one has data points or the size of age and gender od person, participating in a social communication network.
 * One has to be careful and should not be confused by explicit and implicit metadata. Both types can be converted into
 * each other with data aggregation and ectraction procedures which finally form a well defined data set, for which relevant
 * connections to explicit datasets (in this case metadata) are known. All this information is part of the DOAP file, which 
 * allows automatic lookups of background information to datasets.
 * 
 * In many cases, the record metadata is not required in each step of an analysis algorithm. E.g. the k-means classification
 * can be calculated without background knowledge about the data vector which is provided to the algorithm. Each vector represents one
 * object and has an id, this is enough but later during processing, but at the end one has to assign a value which represents the
 * class to that id and this class can become part of the metadata about the object and therefore it should be stored in the
 * metastore as well. In this case the data set contains a URI per vector representing an object. URIs are inefficient because of the
 * higher memory footprint. An internal dictionary is used to track the vector labels and their external URI. As soon as a result
 * dataset is stored, the new information can become an own entitiy in the semantic graph. For each record we add a "classifier result" 
 * which consists of the obtained class or classes and a link to the metainformation about this analysis step. What classification algorithm,
 * what implementation and what parameters have been used to produce this results are part of the analysis step metadata.
 * 
 * Such an integrated approach allows even incremental analysis because all relevant parameters are conserved and can be obtained from the
 * semantic meta stores automatically via appropriate queries, which replace the traditional manually parameter tracking procedures.
