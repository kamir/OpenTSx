# Changelog

All notable changes to OpenTSx are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). There are no tagged releases yet;
entries are grouped by date. The detailed progress log (German) is in
[`EVOLUTION/TASK-011-datamodel-refresher-2026.md`](EVOLUTION/TASK-011-datamodel-refresher-2026.md).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `LICENSE` (Apache License 2.0, full text) and `NOTICE`.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor Covenant 2.1), `SECURITY.md` (reporting via GitHub private
  vulnerability reporting), this changelog.
- `config/opentsx-local.props.example`: localhost / KafScale-compatible Kafka client profile for the 2.x tools.
  Without a local `config/opentsx-local.props` (git-ignored), `OpenTSxClusterLink` falls back to this template.

### Changed
- Default 2.x client profile is now `./config/opentsx-local.props` (was `./config/cpl.props`); scripts, the
  `opentsx-lg` README and `opentsx-default.properties` updated.
- `opentsx.properties.example` lists only keys the code reads and documents how the v2 modules are configured
  (command-line options and environment variables).

### Removed
- Archived Maven modules (`archive/modules/`, `archive/opentsx-kstreams/`) removed from `master`: not built, but
  their outdated dependencies kept raising security alerts and Dependabot PRs. Last state: commit `315f01d`.
- Four dead submodule links in `archive/demos/` (no URL in `.gitmodules`).
- `config/cpl.props`, `config/cpl_iMac.props`, `config/cpl_local.props`, `config/mdc_c1.props` (client profiles with
  private LAN hosts).

## 2026-10-12

### Added
- Digital twin proof of concept `opentsx-twin` (P9): atom contract with model, views, dynamics and policy; wiring
  plan in YAML; layered bulk-synchronous runner; provenance ladder; shadow, what-if and forecast modes. Scenarios:
  energy system / H2 chain (`bin/opentsx twin`), family house with calibration against bills
  (`bin/opentsx house`, `--simulated`), sailing boat Etap 22 with calibration against logger data
  (`bin/opentsx boat`, `--simulated`).
- Smart Topics Studio prototype (`docs/prototypes/smart-topics-studio.html`) and the LabVIEW / command-loop concept.
- Retrieval (`opentsx-retrieval`, P5): segmentation, pattern engine (MASS, SAX, DTW), retrieval API, REST server,
  Python client, power-curve analysis.
- DevOps guide for k3s against an existing KafScale cluster (`docs/devops/`, `deploy/k3s/`, `deploy/docker/`).
- Design documents: Smart Topics (05), interplay & coordination potential (06), digital twin (07), house (08),
  Studio & LabVIEW (09), boat (10), Smart Topic processor & DevOps (11).
- New English user manual (`docs/user-manual/`), documentation inventory, launcher `bin/opentsx`, link check in CI.

### Changed
- 2026 refresh merged into `master` (#102); SaaS frontend/backend dependencies bundled (Vite 7, python-multipart,
  python-socketio).
- README repositioned ("from time series to decisions").

### Removed
- Outdated documentation and modules outside the build moved to `archive/`; `opentsx-app-tools` archived.

## 2026-10-11

### Added
- Streaming statistics and data quality `opentsx-stats` (quantile sketch, DQ, KafScale processor with checkpoints)
  and `opentsx-openmetadata` (metadata pool, validated against the OpenMetadata 2.0.5 schemas); Python
  `opentsx.stats` (P4).
- Wind-farm domain `opentsx-windpark`: IEC 61400-25-2 data-point catalog, normalizer, simulator with ground truth,
  CLI to KafScale / Iceberg.
- Store SPI with contract suite, Iceberg store (index, log sync), OpenTSDB adapter, PyIceberg reader with byte
  equality between Java and Python (P3).
- `opentsx-kafka-v2` (topic layout, bucket writer, episode index, replay, catalog) and `LegacyBucketImport` (P2);
  end-to-end tests against KafScale v1.6.0 and Apache Kafka 3.9.1.

### Changed
- Avro 1.12.1 managed centrally (precision bug in 1.12.0 covered by a test).

## 2026-10-09

### Added
- Data model v2: `opentsx-model` (Java) and `opentsx.model` (Python), byte-identical via shared test vectors;
  `timestamp-micros` (D2) and xxHash64 series identity (D3); legacy bridge; schema history with compatibility check
  (P1).
- KafScale conformance suite (P0): headers and CreateTime are preserved; `offsetsForTimes`, the idempotent producer,
  standalone commits and consumer-group rejoin do not work on KafScale v1.6.0.
- Analysis of the existing model, target model, phase plan and gap analysis (`docs/datamodel-2026/`).
