# Changelog

All notable changes to OpenTSx are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). There are no tagged releases yet;
entries are grouped by date. The detailed progress log (German) is in
[`EVOLUTION/TASK-011-datamodel-refresher-2026.md`](EVOLUTION/TASK-011-datamodel-refresher-2026.md).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Web workbench in `opentsx-saas-frontend` (route `/workbench`): the Swing bucket analyser in the browser. Load a
  bucket (sample, CSV/TSV, episode JSON, retrieval server), apply the time series operations, inspect every result
  on an oscilloscope view (time base, vertical scale, cursors, trigger, measurements), build the processing flow as
  a graph and export it as `opentsx.dag.v1` Smart Topic definition, Processing Flow Descriptor or Java code. See
  [`EVOLUTION/TASK-013-web-workbench.md`](EVOLUTION/TASK-013-web-workbench.md) for the limits: no runtime executes
  the DAG yet.
- TS inventory: the retrieval server reads the episodes topic of a domain from KafScale (`--kafscale <host:port>
  --domain <d>`) and lists every series with extent, value range, episode labels and the ground truth of the
  scenario as time ranges (`GET /v1/inventory`, `opentsx.ts-inventory.v1`). The workbench has a "TS Inventory"
  dialog: filter by tag, channel, scenario event or text, choose window and resolution, load the selection as the
  bucket. `deploy/k3s`: `RETRIEVAL_SOURCE=kafscale`.
- Vector measuring points (draft): operator `align.vector` brings the results of several nodes onto one clock and
  gives one record per tick and key with one value per component (`opentsx.vector.v1`, JSON schema in
  `docs/datamodel-2026/schemas/`, rules in `docs/datamodel-2026/11`, section 5a). The workbench has the operator as
  "Align to vector": nodes can have several inputs, the scope shows the components on one time base, and the DAG
  export writes the node with all inputs and a vector sink. No runtime executes it yet.
- Vector topics are written and read back. The vector processor (`opentsx vectors`, `deploy/k3s`:
  `VECTOR_PROCESSOR=true`) keeps them up to date: it follows the episodes topic, writes a measuring point to
  `tsx.<domain>.smart.<name>.vectors.v1` when every series has passed its tick, checkpoints per sink and reports
  its status. DAGs are deployed and stopped through the control topic `tsx.<domain>.dags.v1`. The retrieval server
  reads the vector topics, so their components show in the TS inventory as series, and it lists the deployments
  (`GET /v1/dags`). The Java operator and the workbench pass the same test vectors
  (`docs/datamodel-2026/testvectors/`).
- Deploying needs an account: the workbench has "Deploy" and "Stop" in the tab "Smart Topic" with the state the
  processor reports, a list of what a deployment needs (ready or missing, step by step) and a button that turns
  the loaded series into a published vector. The SaaS backend checks the account (`POST /api/v1/dags/deploy`, `/stop`; administrators only
  unless `DAG_RUN_ROLE=user`) and forwards with the run token to the retrieval server (`POST /v1/dags/deploy`,
  `/stop`, only with `--kafscale`, `--dag-runs true` and the token `OPENTSX_DAG_RUN_TOKEN`). The frontend image
  does not proxy those write routes. `deploy/k3s`: `RETRIEVAL_DAG_RUNS`, `RETRIEVAL_DAG_RUN_TOKEN` (generated),
  `SAAS_DAG_RUN_ROLE`.
- Workbench: the ground truth of the scenario shows on the scope. Series loaded from the TS inventory bring their
  events (operations, sensor faults) along as bands on the time axis; operators that keep the time axis hand them
  on, and "Segment at threshold" says how many crossings lie inside an event.
- SaaS module, test operation: `TEST_LOGIN=true` (`deploy/k3s`: `SAAS_TEST_LOGIN=true`) lets `admin` with the
  password `admin` sign in as the first administrator; the login page shows it. Off by default.
- Workbench: the "OpenTSx Flow Composer" lists the flows stored in the account in a selection window like the TS
  inventory: filter by text, domain, status or kind, see what a flow reads, computes and publishes and what the
  processor does with it. From there a flow is opened in the editor (several: the first on the workbench, the
  others in tabs of their own), created, renamed, copied, deleted, activated and paused. Activating a flow the
  vector processor can run deploys it, pausing stops it; any other flow is only marked. An opened flow loads the
  series it was built on from the TS inventory, over their whole range.
- Workbench: a deployment belongs to its flow. It is named `<domain>-flow-<id>` (was `<domain>-<track>-smart`),
  so flows of one track no longer replace each other. "Deploy" saves the flow first and marks it active, "Stop"
  marks it paused. A deployment is refused while another running one writes the same topic. Deployments under
  the old name keep running and belong to no flow.
- Workbench: the left side has two tabs. "Input bucket" is the tree of the loaded bucket and the buckets made
  of it; "Smart Topic" (moved there from the inspector) holds publishing, the DAG download and the deployments.
- SaaS frontend: the page after sign-in (`/dashboard`) is the "OpenTSx Flow Composer". It replaces the cards of
  the dashboard by the composer as a whole page: select flows, open them in the editor, create, rename, copy and
  delete them. "Start" and "Stop" (in each row, in the details and for a selection; they replace "Activate" and
  "Pause") run a flow as a Smart Topic on the vector processor. A flow the processor cannot run shows what it
  needs and is no longer marked active.
- CI: jobs "SaaS frontend" (types, lint, tests, build) and "SaaS backend" (pytest).
- SaaS backend: flows are stored per user in the database (`app/api/flows.py`: create, read, update, delete,
  executions), replacing the placeholder routes. The workbench saves a flow to the account and reopens it from the
  dashboard. `opentsx-saas-backend/smoke-flows.sh` checks accounts and flows against a running instance.
- `deploy/k3s`: optional component `saas` (`SAAS=true`): frontend on node port 30311, backend, PostgreSQL; images
  `saas-frontend` and `saas-backend` (`deploy/docker/`).
- `LICENSE` (Apache License 2.0, full text) and `NOTICE`.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor Covenant 2.1), `SECURITY.md` (reporting via GitHub private
  vulnerability reporting), this changelog.
- `config/opentsx-local.props.example`: localhost / KafScale-compatible Kafka client profile for the 2.x tools.
  Without a local `config/opentsx-local.props` (git-ignored), `OpenTSxClusterLink` falls back to this template.

### Fixed
- Vector processor: the first write to a new sink topic stopped the whole processor. The KafScale proxy answers a
  produce request that mixes a topic nobody has written to yet with another one in a way the Kafka client cannot
  parse, and the producer then sent nothing any more, not even status records. Every runner now has its own
  producer and the status records have another; waiting for the broker's confirmation no longer blocks the loop,
  and a producer that gets no answer is closed and replaced.
- Readers no longer end when KafScale refuses fetches for a minute (`Unexpected error code 7 while fetching`): they
  wait it out (`org.opentsx.kafka.Patience`, used by `LogReader`, the statistics processor and `SeriesStatsLog`).
  Producers retry with pauses for up to three minutes instead of five quick attempts
  (`KafScaleClients.producerProps`). The statistics processor used to restart on every such window.
- Retrieval server: a vector topic the broker does not hand out no longer keeps the feed from reading the other
  topics.
- SaaS frontend: the login page showed the default administrator password of a local backend on every
  installation, also where the deployment generates another one. The hint now appears in the dev server only.
  A wrong password reloaded the page instead of showing the error; the form now reports it.
- SaaS backend: registration failed against a real database (`MissingGreenlet`), every authenticated request
  answered 401 (numeric token subject), and a refresh token was accepted as access token.

### Changed
- Default 2.x client profile is now `./config/opentsx-local.props` (was `./config/cpl.props`); scripts, the
  `opentsx-lg` README and `opentsx-default.properties` updated.
- `opentsx.properties.example` lists only keys the code reads and documents how the v2 modules are configured
  (command-line options and environment variables).

### Removed
- Archived Maven modules (`archive/modules/`, `archive/opentsx-kstreams/`) removed from `master`: not built, but
  their outdated dependencies kept raising security alerts and Dependabot PRs. Last state: commit `315f01d`.
- Four dead submodule links in `archive/demos/` (no URL in `.gitmodules`).
- `config/cpl.props`, `config/cpl_iMac.props`, `config/cpl_local.props`, `config/mdc_c1.props` (client profiles with
  private LAN hosts).

## 2026-10-12

### Added
- Digital twin proof of concept `opentsx-twin` (P9): atom contract with model, views, dynamics and policy; wiring
  plan in YAML; layered bulk-synchronous runner; provenance ladder; shadow, what-if and forecast modes. Scenarios:
  energy system / H2 chain (`bin/opentsx twin`), family house with calibration against bills
  (`bin/opentsx house`, `--simulated`), sailing boat Etap 22 with calibration against logger data
  (`bin/opentsx boat`, `--simulated`).
- Smart Topics Studio prototype (`docs/prototypes/smart-topics-studio.html`) and the LabVIEW / command-loop concept.
- Studio guide (`StudioGuide`, `twin/haus-erzgebirge.guide.yaml`, `twin/h2-chain.guide.yaml`): prose for every atom,
  port, parameter, control and wire of the house twin and the H2 chain, where each value comes from and references to compare against; checked against the plan.
  The node graph explains wires and ports on hover, and each node takes own details (nameplate, serial number, own
  parameter values) with export as inventory (`opentsx.inventory.v1`) and as an own wiring plan.
- Smart Topics Studio redesigned as a product component after reviews from four viewpoints (UI design, UX and
  accessibility, electrical and energy engineering, commercial reader): app bar with scenario switch, scenario summary
  with headline figures and the question behind it, views Überblick, Vergleich, Systembild and Messreihen, inspector
  beside the diagram, connections coloured by energy carrier and routed around the blocks, events in plain language,
  larger units from a threshold on, limit lines in charts, a switch for technical details. Engineering corrections
  in both guides.
- Smart Topics Studio as a tool shell: title bar with menus (Datei, Ansicht, Szenario, Hilfe), icon rail on the left
  that expands and collapses, scenarios as document tabs, detail panel for blocks and connections sliding in from the
  right, status bar. Keyboard: Alt+1 to Alt+4 for the views, Ctrl+B for the rail, Esc closes the detail panel.
  The document tabs belong to the current scenario: the scenario itself, a link to its page in the Anlagen-Explorer,
  and an event topic view.
- Event topic of a twin run (`opentsx-twin-live`): `EventPublisher` writes the events of a run to
  `twin.<id>.<run>.events` (key: atom, value: JSON `twin.event.v1`), at once or played over a given duration;
  `EventBridge` serves such a topic to browsers as server-sent events; `bin/opentsx twin-live publish|bridge|demo`.
  The Studio follows the topic live through the bridge and keeps a replay that needs no broker. The publisher creates
  the topic before the first event, so a reader can connect while the run has not reported anything yet.
- k3s component `event-bridge` (`EVENT_BRIDGE=true`): the event bridge as Deployment and Service on NodePort 30312;
  `twin-live` is part of the tools image and takes the broker from `KAFSCALE_BOOTSTRAP`.
- Retrieval (`opentsx-retrieval`, P5): segmentation, pattern engine (MASS, SAX, DTW), retrieval API, REST server,
  Python client, power-curve analysis.
- DevOps guide for k3s against an existing KafScale cluster (`docs/devops/`, `deploy/k3s/`, `deploy/docker/`).
- Design documents: Smart Topics (05), interplay & coordination potential (06), digital twin (07), house (08),
  Studio & LabVIEW (09), boat (10), Smart Topic processor & DevOps (11).
- New English user manual (`docs/user-manual/`), documentation inventory, launcher `bin/opentsx`, link check in CI.

### Changed
- 2026 refresh merged into `master` (#102); SaaS frontend/backend dependencies bundled (Vite 7, python-multipart,
  python-socketio).
- README repositioned ("from time series to decisions").

### Removed
- Outdated documentation and modules outside the build moved to `archive/`; `opentsx-app-tools` archived.

## 2026-10-11

### Added
- Streaming statistics and data quality `opentsx-stats` (quantile sketch, DQ, KafScale processor with checkpoints)
  and `opentsx-openmetadata` (metadata pool, validated against the OpenMetadata 2.0.5 schemas); Python
  `opentsx.stats` (P4).
- Wind-farm domain `opentsx-windpark`: IEC 61400-25-2 data-point catalog, normalizer, simulator with ground truth,
  CLI to KafScale / Iceberg.
- Store SPI with contract suite, Iceberg store (index, log sync), OpenTSDB adapter, PyIceberg reader with byte
  equality between Java and Python (P3).
- `opentsx-kafka-v2` (topic layout, bucket writer, episode index, replay, catalog) and `LegacyBucketImport` (P2);
  end-to-end tests against KafScale v1.6.0 and Apache Kafka 3.9.1.

### Changed
- Avro 1.12.1 managed centrally (precision bug in 1.12.0 covered by a test).

## 2026-10-09

### Added
- Data model v2: `opentsx-model` (Java) and `opentsx.model` (Python), byte-identical via shared test vectors;
  `timestamp-micros` (D2) and xxHash64 series identity (D3); legacy bridge; schema history with compatibility check
  (P1).
- KafScale conformance suite (P0): headers and CreateTime are preserved; `offsetsForTimes`, the idempotent producer,
  standalone commits and consumer-group rejoin do not work on KafScale v1.6.0.
- Analysis of the existing model, target model, phase plan and gap analysis (`docs/datamodel-2026/`).
