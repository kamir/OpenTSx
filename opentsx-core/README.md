# opentsx-core: classic analysis library (2.x model)

This is the original OpenTSx library. It works on `TimeSeriesObject` and TSBucket (Hadoop SequenceFile) and is
**legacy, but maintained**: it builds on Java 17 and is used by `opentsx-connectors`, `opentsx-lg`,
`opentsx-flink-core` and `opentsx-legacy-bridge`.

| Package | Content |
|---------|---------|
| `org.opentsx.data.series` | `TimeSeriesObject` |
| `org.opentsx.data.loader`, `data.generator` | `MessreihenLoader` (CSV), `RNGWrapper` |
| `org.opentsx.core` | `TSBucket`, configuration (`core.config.ConfigManager`) |
| `org.opentsx.algorithms.detrending` | DFA (`methods.DFA`), `SingleDFATool`, `MultiDFATool`, `MFDFAAnalyzer` |
| `org.opentsx.algorithms.ris` | return-interval statistics (`RISTool`) |
| `org.opentsx.algorithms.eventsynchronisation` | event synchronization (`ESCalc`) |
| `org.opentsx.algorithms.statistics` | Granger causality, entropy, distribution tests |
| `org.opentsx.generators` | `TSGenerator`, `LongTermCorrelationSeriesGenerator`, `FFTPhaseRandomizer` |
| `org.opentsx.app.bucketanalyser` | `MacroRecorder2` GUI (`bin/000_launch_tsa_workbench.sh`) |
| `org.opentsx.demo.onboarding` | guided demos (`bin/episode_*.sh`) |

* **User guide:** [`docs/user-manual/11-classic-analytics.md`](../docs/user-manual/11-classic-analytics.md). For new
  work, the Python implementations (`opentsx.DFA`, `MFDFA`, `EventSynchronization`, `RIS`) are the recommended
  interface.
* **v2 data:** convert episodes with `opentsx-legacy-bridge`.

## Check bucket workflow support

`TSBucket.loadViaContext` throws `UnsupportedOperationException` with
`Context-based bucket loading is not implemented`. `TSBucket.processBucket` throws the same exception type with
`Named bucket processing is not implemented`. Neither entry point reads input or returns a processed bucket.
`MacroRunner` and the Java/Scala workflow export call these entry points, so executing those workflows stops at
the unsupported call. The separate `BucketLoader` and `loadFromSequenceFile` APIs are not routed through these methods.

## Inspect FFT coordinates

`TimeSeriesObjectFFT.convertToMessreiheFFT` copies both coordinate arrays into independent vectors.
`getFFT(samplingRate)` preserves the frequency coordinates computed by `calcFFT`: bin `k` has coordinate
`k * samplingRate / N`, where `N` is the padded transform length. The result contains the real components of the
coefficients; it does not represent the full complex spectrum. Supply the sampling rate in samples per time unit.
The Swing FFT action derives the sampling rate from increasing, uniformly spaced coordinates. Frequencies use
the reciprocal of the coordinate unit, so coordinates in seconds produce frequencies in hertz.
Integer coordinates with spacing 1 are treated as indices and require an explicit sampling rate in the dialog.
Cancelling the dialog produces no chart or recorded transformation. Empty selections, fewer than three samples,
unequal coordinate and value counts, non-finite data, and non-uniform coordinates produce an error message.

`TimeSeriesObjectFFT` uses English headers, diagnostics and error messages. Averaged series use the `Mean_` label prefix.
